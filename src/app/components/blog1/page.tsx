5 Tools for Visualizing Machine Learning Models

Machine learning (ML) models are built upon data. They are like the ready-to-use artifacts resulting from making sense of a dataset to uncover patterns, make predictions, or automate decisions. Whilst visualizing data is undoubtedly important across many data science processes like exploratory analysis and feature engineering, the idea of visualizing an ML model is not as straightforward: it entails understanding its structure, performance, and behavior to make decisions, often requiring specialized tools and techniques.

This article lists 5 tools you might not know to help you visualize and gain insight into the nature and operation of your ML models
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h1>TensorBoard</h1>
      <p >Tensor Board is a commonly used tool for visualizing advanced ML models primarily neural network-based models built with TensorFlow. Focused on experimentation the tool supports graph-based model architecture visualization tracking of training metrics like loss and accuracy and model weights visualizations like histograms among others. By using the appropriate design patterns like wrappers and the Keras API TensorBoard can be also used to visualize aspects of classical ML models built with other libraries like scikit-learn. This is a fairly balanced and multi-purpose model visualization tool overall.

      </p>
      <h1>Yellowbrick</h1>
      <p>Yellowbrick is a Python library for model diagnostics and evaluation. It extends scikit-learn to support model selection, by offering an assortment of sophisticated and highly customizable metric visualizations like learning curves residual plots and ROC curves It is a very powerful tool for enhanced model evaluation but it might not be as popular as others hence the supporting documentation available is comparatively limited.
